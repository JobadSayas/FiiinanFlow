# Finance React - Personal Finance Tracking System

## Description
This project began in 2018 shortly after I got married, with the goal of creating a collaborative system for tracking expenses with my wife. Initially, I developed it using jQuery for the frontend and PHP for the backend, allowing us to have a custom-tailored tool to manage and monitor our finances.

As our needs evolved, I continuously updated the app to make expense tracking more intuitive and user-friendly. In 2023, I decided to transition the application to React, taking advantage of its modern capabilities to improve performance, scalability, and user experience.
